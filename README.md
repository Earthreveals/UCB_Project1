# Polar Bear Health and Climate Change Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of polar bear health in relation to climate change, specifically examining the relationship between polar bear mass, temperature, and age. The project aims to understand how changing environmental conditions impact polar bear populations and suggest conservation efforts based on the findings.

## Introduction

Polar bears are an iconic species of the Arctic, heavily dependent on sea ice for their survival. This project analyzes how climate change, particularly rising temperatures and declining sea ice, affects polar bear mass and overall health. By understanding these relationships, we can develop more effective conservation strategies.

## Data

The data used in this project includes:
- Historical records of polar bear mass and age.
- Temperature data over a period of 36 years in the Beaufort Sea region.
- Sea ice extent and other relevant environmental variables.

## Analysis

The analysis involves:
1. Cleaning and formatting the datasets using Pandas.
2. Performing statistical tests, such as Pearson's correlation, to examine the relationships between variables.
3. Creating visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate the trends and correlations.
4. Drawing conclusions based on the statistical results and visualizations.

## Results

The key findings of this project include:
- A lack of significant linear correlation between polar bear mass and year/age, suggesting other factors might be at play.
- Observations of periods where temperature increases coincide with decreases in polar bear mass.
- Highlighting the importance of seals in the polar bear diet and the impact of diminishing sea ice on their hunting grounds.

## Conservation Efforts

Based on the analysis, the following conservation efforts are recommended:
- Mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
- Protecting critical sea ice habitats and denning areas.
- Ensuring the conservation of prey species like seals.
- Reducing human-bear conflicts through community education and waste management practices.
- Continued monitoring and research to inform adaptive management strategies.

## Future Outlook

The future of polar bears is closely linked to the trajectory of global climate change. Efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and protect Arctic habitats are crucial for their survival. Ongoing research and international cooperation are necessary to support effective conservation strategies.
